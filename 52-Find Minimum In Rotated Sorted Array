                🔹 How to determine if the left half is sorted?
                   If arr[low] < arr[mid], then the segment [low...mid] is sorted.
                   In a rotated sorted array with all unique elements, a properly sorted
                   half will always have the first element < the last element.
            
                ✅ Example:
                   arr = [4, 5, 6, 7, 0, 1, 2]
                   low = 0, mid = 3 → arr[low] = 4, arr[mid] = 7 → 4 < 7 → left half is sorted
            
                🔸 Binary Search Use Case:
                   - If the pivot is not in the sorted half, eliminate that half
                   - Continue searching in the unsorted half
             */

            /*
                🔹 Why is the condition (low == mid) important?
            
                ⚠️ Edge Case Example: [8, 9, 2, 3, 4]
                Step-by-step:
                - Initially: low = 0, high = 4
                - mid = (0 + 4) / 2 = 2
                - arr[mid] = 2, arr[low] = 8
            
                Since arr[low] > arr[mid], pivot lies in the left half
                → Move left: low = 0, high = 1
            
                Now:
                - mid = (0 + 1) / 2 = 0
            
                If we check: arr[low] < arr[mid] → 8 < 8 → false
                This would incorrectly indicate an unsorted left half.
                We move left → high = mid - 1 = -1 → out of bounds!
            
                ❌ Problem: We exit the loop without finding the pivot.
            
                ✅ Solution:
                When low == mid, it means the left half contains only one element,
                which is trivially sorted. So, we must move to the right (low = mid + 1)
                to avoid incorrect movement.
             */

            // Note:  Since the array is rotated (Ascending order), the largest element (pivot) cannot be at the last index, so mid will never equal arr.length - 1 during pivot search
            if (low == mid || arr[low] < arr[mid]) {
                // Left half is sorted or only one element → pivot is in the right half
                low = mid + 1;
            } else {
                // Right half is sorted, so pivot must be in the left half → move search to left half
                /*
                      Important note:
                      So, in a rotated sorted array (with or without duplicates), at least one half (left or right) is always sorted.
                      
                      Example: arr = [6, 7, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
                      low = 0, high = 6, mid = 3, arr[mid] = 2
                
                      Check left half [low..mid]: arr[low] = 6, arr[mid] = 2
                      Since 6 > 2, left half is NOT sorted.
                      That means right half [mid..high] is sorted.
                      Therefore, pivot must lie in the left half.
                      So, we move 'high' pointer to mid - 1 to search left half.
                */
                high = mid - 1;
            }
        }

        // Ideally unreachable for a valid rotated sorted array
        return -1;
    }
}
