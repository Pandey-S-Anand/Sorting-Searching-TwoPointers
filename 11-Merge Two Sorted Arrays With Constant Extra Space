//Naive Approach

/*
Step 1:
We start by comparing the last elements of arr1 (starting from the end)
with the first elements of arr2 (starting from the beginning).

The goal is to ensure that all elements in arr1 are smaller than or equal to
those in arr2 — since arr1 should contain the smaller half and arr2 the larger half
of the final sorted array.

If arr1[i] > arr2[j], it means the element in arr1 is too large for its position
and should be swapped with the smaller element in arr2.

We continue this until we find a case where arr1[i] <= arr2[j].
At that point, we break early because all remaining elements in arr1 (before index i)
are guaranteed to be less than or equal to elements in arr2 (due to initial sorted order),
so further swaps aren't needed.

Step 2:
After the swapping phase, we sort both arr1 and arr2 individually
to ensure both arrays are completely sorted and represent the final merged order.

Dry Run:

Given input:
arr1: [1, 3, 5, 7]
arr2: [0, 2, 6, 8, 9]

First Pass:
i = 3, j = 0 → 7 > 0 → swap → arr1: [1, 3, 5, 0], arr2: [7, 2, 6, 8, 9]
Second Pass:
i = 2, j = 1 → 5 > 2 → swap → arr1: [1, 3, 2, 0], arr2: [7, 5, 6, 8, 9]
Third Pass:
i = 1, j = 2 → 3 < 6 → break

Final Sort:
arr1 = [0, 1, 2, 3]
arr2 = [5, 6, 7, 8, 9]
