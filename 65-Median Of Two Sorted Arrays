//Optimal Approach

/*

Case 1: When merged array size is Even:

Given,
arr1[] ={1, 3, 4, 7, 10, 12}
arr2[]= {2, 3, 6, 15}

          0  1  2  3  4  5  6   7   8   9
merged[]={1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, 15};     //only possible valid configuration for merged[] array

median = arr[9/2] + arr[10/2] = (4+6) / 2 = 5

left half = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4} and right half = {6, 7, 10, 12, 15} 

median = (max of left half(i.e 4) + min of right subarray(i.e 6)) / 2 = (4 + 6) / 2 = 5


Case 2: When merged array size is Odd :

Given,
arr1[]={1, 3, 4, 7,  10, 12}
arr2[]={2, 3, 6, 15, 18}

merged[] = {1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, 15, 18} //only possible valid configuration for merged[] array

Let half ={1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 6} and right half ={7, 10, 12, 15, 18}

Median = max left half = 6

Note :  1: For any two sorted  arrays(that forms odd length merged array on merging), the left half size will be (n/2 + 1)  and right half size will be (n/2)  (where n = size of the merged array)
        2: For any two sorted arrays (that form even length merged array on merging), both the left half and right half will have equal size (i.e n/2 , where n = size of merged array)
        3: For any two sorted arrays ,there exists only 1 valid configuration of merged[] array that satisfies the below mentioned conditions.
             >All the elements of the left part of the merged[] array will be less than or equal to the elements in the right half of the merged array.
             >To test if all the elements in the left half are smaller than than or equal to the elements in the right half, compare the last element(max of left half)
               With the first element of the right half (min of right half) since both the left and right half are sorted.
             >Since we are not actually merging the arrays, so we won’t be having left half and right half in the form of array, to find the max in the left half, we need to 
                take maximum out of elements chosen from arr1(for left half) and arr2 (for left half),the maximum of two will give us the maximum of left half. Similarly to find the 
                Minimum of right half we need to take the minimum of elements chosen from arr1(for right half) and arr2(for right half), the minimum of two will give us the minimum of 
                right half.

==================================================
