    💡 Conceptual Clarification for Gas Station Placement
    ============================================

    ❓ Q1: Can we place the `k` gas stations on the extreme ends (before the first or after the last station)?
    
    ✅ Yes, it's technically possible.
    🚫 But it’s NOT helpful in minimizing the maximum distance between adjacent stations.

    🔍 Why?
    - The problem asks to minimize the **maximum gap** between any two *adjacent* stations.
    - Placing a station before the first or after the last doesn't affect any existing gap between two stations.
    - Therefore, extreme-end placements do not help reduce the largest gap.

    Example:
    arr = [1, 4], k = 1
    → Max gap = 3

    If we place the new station at 0 or 10 → no change in the largest internal gap (still 3).
    But if we place it at 2.5 → max gap reduces to 1.5 (much better).

    ✅ Conclusion:
    Always focus on placing stations **within** the intervals between existing stations.

    ----------------------------------------------------

    ❓ Q2: Is it always possible to place all `k` gas stations *between* existing stations?

    ✅ Yes, always possible — even for very large values of `k`, like 10000.

    🔍 Why?
    - You can split any interval into as many parts as needed using **floating-point** positions.
    - Even a single gap (e.g., [1, 2]) can hold 10000 stations:
        → Place one every (1 / (k + 1)) = ~0.000099 units apart

    Example:
    arr = [1, 2], k = 10000
    → We can place new stations at positions like 1.0001, 1.0002, ..., 1.9999

    ✅ Conclusion:
    Yes, all `k` stations can be placed between existing stations, thanks to unlimited precision via decimal placements.

    ----------------------------------------------------

    ✅ Final Note:
    The optimal strategy is always to place new stations *within* the largest current gaps.
    Placing stations at extreme ends is allowed but never beneficial.
