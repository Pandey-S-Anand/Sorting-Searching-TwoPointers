Note 1:

An array/string of length N has N! permutations. 

For example, for arr = [1,2,3.4]

The following are all the permutations of arr: 

[1, 2, 3, 4] 
[1, 2, 4, 3] 
[1, 3, 2, 4] 
[1, 3, 4, 2] 
[1, 4, 3, 2] 
[1, 4, 2, 3] 
[2, 1, 3, 4] 
[2, 1, 4, 3] 
[2, 3, 1, 4] 
[2, 3, 4, 1] 
[2, 4, 3, 1] 
[2, 4, 1, 3] 
[3, 2, 1, 4] 
[3, 2, 4, 1] 
[3, 1, 2, 4] 
[3, 1, 4, 2] 
[3, 4, 1, 2] 
[3, 4, 2, 1] 
[4, 2, 3, 1] 
[4, 2, 1, 3] 
[4, 3, 2, 1] 
[4, 3, 1, 2] 
[4, 1, 3, 2]
[4, 1, 2, 3] 

If all the permutations of the array are sorted in ascending order ,then the next permutation of that array is the permutation that follows it in the sorted(Ascending) order.

The following are all the permutations of arr in sorted order: 

[1,2,3,4] 
[1,2,4,3] 
[1,3,2,4] 
[1,3,4,2] 
[1,4,2,3] 
[1,4,3,2] 
[2,1,3,4] 
[2,1,4,3] 
[2,3,1,4] 
[2,3,4,1] 
[2,4,1,3] 
[2,4,3,1] 
[3,1,2,4] 
[3,1,4,2] 
[3,2,1,4] 
[3,2,4,1] 
[3,4,1,2] 
[3,4,2,1] 
[4,1,2,3] 
[4,1,3,2] 
[4,2,1,3] 
[4,2,3,1] 
[4,3,1,2] 
[4,3,2,1]

so the next permutation of {1,2,3,4} is {1,2,4,3}

Note 2:
If we  initially sort the array in ascending order and then generate all its permutations they will naturally appear in **sorted lexicographical order**.

Note 3:

If all the permutations of an array are sorted in ascending order,On careful observation we find that every permutation has the following structure :

same as immediate previous permutation | break point | Sorted in Descending Order 

Ex:

[4,1,2,3]
   ^  
   |
[4,1,3,2]
4 | 1 | 3, 2

(Immediate previous permutation of [4,1,3,2] is [4,1,2,3])

Note 4:

Approach to solve the problem :

The steps are the following:

1: Find the break-point, break-point means the first index 'i' from the back of the given array where arr[i] becomes smaller than arr[i+1].
For example, if the given array is {2,1,5,4,3,0,0}, the break-point will be index 1(0-based indexing), traversing from the back, index 1 is the first index where arr[1] (i.e. 1) is smaller than arr[i+1] (i.e. 5).

2:
If a break-point does not exist i.e. if the array is sorted in decreasing order, the given permutation is the last one in the sorted order of all possible permutations. 
So, the next permutation will be the first permutation in the sorted order Note that first permutation in the sorted order of all possible permutations is in increasing order.

3:
If a break-point exists:
(Note: In every permutation after breakpoint(index) the sequence is sorted in descending order)
Find the smallest number in the right half of the breakpoint which is greater than arr[breakPoint] 
and swap it with arr[breakPoint].

Now sort the right half of the breakpoint in ascending order.
(Note: Right half range: (breakpoint+1) to (arr.length-1)) 

Optimisation Tip:
Since the right half of the breakpoint is already sorted in descending order and an array sorted in descending order can be sorted into ascending order either by using Arrays.sort() or by reversing the array and finally, return the array.
(Note : Reversing the array is the effecient way to sort an array in descending order into ascending order)
