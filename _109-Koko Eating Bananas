        /**
        * The problem guarantees that `piles.length ≤ h`, ensuring that  
        * Koko can always finish all the bananas within `h` hours.  
        *
        * ### Worst-Case Scenario:  
        * - If `h == piles.length`, Koko has at least one hour per pile.  
        * - Her minimum required speed will match the largest pile’s size (`max(piles) bananas/hour`).  
        * - This guarantees that there always exists a feasible speed that allows  
        *   her to eat all bananas within the given time.  
        *
        * ### Example:  
        * Given `h = 8` and `piles = [5, 6, 8, 2, 10, 7, 4, 3]`:  
        * - The largest pile has `10` bananas.  
        * - If Koko eats at `k = 10` bananas per hour, she will finish the largest pile in `1` hour.  
        * - The remaining piles take `1` hour each.  
        * - Since `h = 8`, she will finish exactly within the given time.  
        *
        * ### Key Observations:  
        * - The **maximum possible eating speed per hour** is equal to the **largest pile size**.  
        * - Eating at a speed greater than this value is unnecessary because **it won't reduce the total hours**.  
        * - Eating speed can **never be `0`**, because Koko must eat **all** the bananas.  
        *   - If `speed = 0`, Koko wouldn't eat anything, violating the problem constraints.  
        *
        * ### When `k = 1` Occurs:  
        * - `k = 1` happens when Koko has **a lot of hours (`h`)** compared to the total number of bananas.  
        * - This situation is possible when `h` is **very large** relative to the sum of bananas.  
        *
        * ### Search Range for Speed:  
        * - The valid range for `k` is **from `1` to `max(piles)`**.
