 Problem:
 --------
 Given a 4-digit number, split its digits into two 2-digit numbers
 such that their sum is minimized. All digits must be used and
 leading zeros are allowed.

 Key Idea :
 -------------------------------------
 The tens place contributes 10× more than the ones place.
 Therefore, to minimize the total sum, we must minimize the digits
 placed in the tens position of the two numbers.

 Approach:
 ---------
 1) Extract the four digits and sort them in ascending order.
 2) Place the two smallest digits in the tens place of the two numbers.
 3) Place the remaining two digits in the ones place.

 Why the ones-place order does NOT matter:
 -----------------------------------------
 After fixing the tens digits, the two numbers are formed as:

     num1 = (10 * smallest1) + (remainingX OR remainingY)
     num2 = (10 * smallest2) + (remainingY OR remainingX)

 where remainingX and remainingY are the two remaining digits.
 The use of OR indicates that either remaining digit can be placed
 in either number’s ones place.

 Total Sum:
 ----------
     num1 + num2
   = (10 * smallest1 + remainingX) + (10 * smallest2 + remainingY)
   = 10 * (smallest1 + smallest2) + (remainingX + remainingY)

 Since the ones-place digits are added directly (multiplied by 1),
 their order does not affect the total sum:
     (remainingX + remainingY) = (remainingY + remainingX)

 Hence, the remaining two digits can be placed in either number’s
 ones place without changing the final sum.

 Conclusion:
 -----------
 Minimizing the tens-place digits guarantees the minimum possible sum,
 and no specific ordering is required for the ones-place digits.

    public int minimumSum(int num) {
        int[] arr = new int[4];
        int idx = 0;

        //Extract the four digits of the number
        while (num != 0) {
            arr[idx++] = num % 10;
            num /= 10;
        }

        //Sort the digits in ascending order
        Arrays.sort(arr);

         Construct the two 2-digit numbers

         - To minimize the sum, place the two smallest digits in the tens place.
         - The remaining two digits go to the ones place.
        
         Optimal pairings (both give the same minimum sum):
        
         Option 1:
           num1 = arr[0] * 10 + arr[3]
           num2 = arr[1] * 10 + arr[2]
        
         Option 2:
           num1 = arr[0] * 10 + arr[2]
           num2 = arr[1] * 10 + arr[3]
        
         Both are optimal because once the tens-place digits are fixed,
         the ones-place digits are interchangeable and do not affect the total sum.
