     Brute Force Approach:
     --------------------
     - Guess numbers sequentially from 1 to n.
     - For each guess, call the guess(num) API.
     - When guess(num) returns 0, the picked number is found.
    
     Time Complexity:
     ----------------
     O(n) API calls in the worst case.
    
     Note:
     -----
     The problem note guarantees that a number is picked within
     the range [1, n], so the return statement at the end
     will never be reached.

//Optimal Approach

public class Solution extends GuessGame {
    /*
     Binary Search Approach:
     -----------------------
     The picked number lies in the range [1, n].
    
     The guess(int num) API gives directional feedback:
       - -1 → guessed number is higher than the picked number
       -  1 → guessed number is lower than the picked number
       -  0 → correct guess
    
     This feedback forms a monotonic search space, making
     Binary Search the optimal strategy.
    
     Intuition:
     ----------
     - If guess(mid) == 0, we have found the picked number.
     - If guess(mid) == -1, the picked number lies to the left of mid.
     - If guess(mid) == 1, the picked number lies to the right of mid.
    
     By eliminating half of the search space after each guess,
     we minimize the number of API calls.
    
     Complexity:
     -----------
     Time  : O(log n) API calls
     Space : O(1)
