class Solution {
    /*
     Problem:
     --------
     You are given two arrays arr1 and arr2 of equal size N.
     You are allowed to rearrange (shuffle) the elements of both arrays.

     Your task is to minimize the value:
         arr1[0] * arr2[0] + arr1[1] * arr2[1] + ... + arr1[N-1] * arr2[N-1]

     Optimal Strategy:
     -----------------
     To obtain the minimum possible sum:
     - Sort arr1 in ascending order
     - Sort arr2 in descending order
     - Multiply corresponding elements and add them

     Why this works:
     ---------------
     Pairing the smallest element from one array with the largest element
     from the other array minimizes the contribution of each product.

     Intuition:
     ----------
     Large numbers increase the product magnitude.
     By multiplying large values with small ones (instead of large-large),
     we keep the overall sum as small as possible.

        Collections.sort(arr2, Collections.reverseOrder());

        long sum = 0;

        // Compute the minimum sum of products
        for (int i = 0; i < arr1.size(); i++) {
            sum += (long) arr1.get(i) * arr2.get(i);
        }
